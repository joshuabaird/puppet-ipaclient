IPAclient
========

This module configures clients to use FreeIPA with as little fuss as possible.  This module used to be known as stbenjam/puppet-ipaclient, but is now being maintained at joshuabaird/puppet-ipaclient.

Thanks to all the [contributors](https://github.com/stbenjam/puppet-ipaclient/graphs/contributors)!

Basically, any Red Hat or Debian derivative with packages.

Examples
--------

See the manifests for full descriptions of the various parameters
available.

Discovery register (w/ sane defaults: sudo, mkhomedir, ssh, etc):

    class { 'ipaclient':
      password => "rainbows",
    }

More complex:

    class { 'ipaclient':
       principal       => "admin",
       password        => "unicorns",
       server          => ["ipa01.pixiedust.com", "ipa02.pixiedust.com"],
       domain          => "pixiedust.com",
       realm           => "PIXEDUST.COM",
       mkhomedir       => false,
       automount       => true,
       ssh             => false,
       fixed_primary   => true,
       automount_location => "home",
    }

Simple sudoers setup (only needed for older FreeIPA 3.x clients):

    class { 'ipaclient::sudoers': }

Note that starting with RHEL 6.6 and RHEL 7.1, ```ipa-client-install``` automatically takes care of all sudo configuration.  If you are running these versions, this module will not attempt to perform any sudo configuration.

Automounter only:

    class { 'ipaclient::automount':
        location    => 'home',
        server      => 'ipa01.pixiedust.com',
    }
